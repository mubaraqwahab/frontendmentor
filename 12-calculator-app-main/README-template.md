## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser


## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- XState and the Stately Studio

TODO: Talk about

* using state machines
* making the calc accessible with `<output>`, aria `toolbar`, the roving tab index, `&minus;` and keyboard input

### What I learned

TODO: Write about these:

* accesskey and data-keyshortcuts

### Continued development

TODO: Issues

* Whenever the display changes, NVDA announces all the display content. Is this a problem?
* When the display ends with a number like `2.`, NVDA reads "two" and ignores the point.
* Exposing keyboard shortcuts to screen readers. NVDA reads aria-keyshortcuts after the accessible name without specifying it's a shortcut.

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
