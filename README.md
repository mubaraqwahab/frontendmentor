Playground for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.

[Live site](https://mubaraqwahab.github.io/frontendmentor/)

I'm using this to practice things frontend-related:

* Semantic markup + accessibility
* Responsive, mobile-first design
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Web technologies, frameworks etc.
