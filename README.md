Playground for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.

[Live site](https://mubaraqwahab.github.io/frontendmentor/)

I'm using this to practice things frontend-related:

* Semantic markup + accessibility.
* Responsive, mobile-first design.
* Cross-browser compatibility.
* UI state management.
* Web frameworks.
* Build processes, etc.

## Guidelines...

* Whenever you need to use local storage in a challenge, prefix the storage key with the challenge name (e.g, `"calculator-app-theme"`, not `"theme"`) to avoid potential clashes with keys for other challenges.
